--   Drawing primitives — the one home for the box-drawing vocabulary of
--   doc/TYPOGRAPHY.md. Runtime code that prints a heading or a divider asks for
--   a 'Weight' and gets the right Unicode glyph; it never spells out a '━' (or,
--   worse, an ASCII '='). Centralised so the next ergonomics change is one edit
--   here, not a sweep across every call site. (Source-file banners are comments
--   pinned to column 100 by tooling and live outside this module.)

{- | @infer -r\/--recursive <path>@: annotate every @.nix@ file under a directory
(or the single file, if @path@ is one) in place. Each file is handled independently
and NON-fatally — a parse, depth, or type error skips just that file and leaves it
untouched (never a clobber), while the rest proceed. File discovery honours the
configured ignores (the same 'collectFiles' the CI sweep uses), and the nixpkgs
index is built once for the whole run (see 'Handlers.enrichInferEnvBatch') rather
than per file. A summary is printed at the end; the command always exits success —
a file that doesn't type-check is expected, not a failure of @infer@.

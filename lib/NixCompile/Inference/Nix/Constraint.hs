--   The inference monad and its state: a `State`+`Except` stack (no IO — that
--   is load-bearing, it is why the oracle can replay inference). Fresh-var
--   supply, the triangular substitution, the accumulated output bindings, the
--   current source span, and the `with`-scope memo all live here, along with
--   the primitive operations (freshVar / addSubst / applyCurrentSubst /
--   withSpan / throwTypeError / emitBinding) that the unifier and the
--   inference core are built from.

{- | Extend the current substitution with @v ↦ t@.

We keep a TRIANGULAR substitution (a plain insert) rather than eagerly
composing. The old @composeSubst@ form re-walked and rewrote the entire
accumulated substitution on every bind — O(n) per bind, O(n²) over a program
with n unifications (RC4). 'applySubst' already chases transitively (the @TVar@
case recurses through bound vars), so resolution still fully normalises on read.

Soundness invariant: every caller binds @v@ to a @t@ that has already been
resolved against the current substitution ('applyCurrentSubst' in 'unify' /
'mergeTypes' / 'unifyRec'), and 'bindVar'/'bindRowVar' run the occurs check on
that resolved @t@. So @v@ is unbound and @t@ is ground w.r.t. current bindings at
insert time — the substitution stays acyclic and the on-read chase terminates.

--    'em grow food. Make 'em heat themselves, generate power, whatever. But
--    this one, you drill far enough down, is sitting on top of a lot of
--    geothermal water. It's real hot down there, but not hot enough to run an
--    engine, so it wasn't gonna give 'em any power. They made a stab at
--    power, up on the roof, with about a hundred Darrieus rotors, what they
--    call eggbeaters. Had themselves a wind farm, see?"
